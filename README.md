Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repo is for the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data.

This text file describes the project approach and key files.


The main file for processing is the R script called run_analysis.R.

The run_analysis.R will perform the steps outlined below:

> Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
> Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
> Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
> Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
> From the data set created in the step above, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
